10435,Y02C  20/10,AIR FILTRATION MEDIA COMPRISING METAL-DOPED SILICON-BASED GEL MATERIALS WITH NITRIC AND/OR POTASSIUM PERSULFATE,"The present invention relates generally to an environmental control unit for use in air handling systems that provides highly effective filtration of noxious gases (such as ammonia). Such a filtration system utilizes novel metal-doped silica-based gels to trap and remove such undesirable gases from an enclosed environment. Such gels exhibit specific porosity requirements and density measurements. Furthermore, in order for proper metal doping to take effect, such gels must be treated while in a wet state. The combination of these particular properties and metal dopant permits highly effective noxious gas filtration such that uptake and breakthrough results are attained, particularly in comparison with prior silica gel filtration products. Also included is the presence of an oxidizing agent to aid in capturing nitrous oxide and preventing conversion of such a product to NO. Methods of using and specific filter apparatuses are also encompassed within this invention."
10627,Y02C  20/40,MOLECULAR SIEVE AND MEMBRANE SYSTEM TO PURIFY NATURAL GAS,The invention comprises a process of removing carbon dioxide from a natural gas feed stream comprising sending a natural gas feed stream comprising methane and carbon dioxide through an adsorbent bed to produce a carbon dioxide depleted methane rich product stream after removal of carbon dioxide. The adsorbent bed is regenerated and then the spent regeneration gas stream cooled to produce a cooled spent regeneration gas stream that is sent to a membrane element. A permeate stream passes through the membrane element and a residue stream passes by the membrane element without passing through said membrane element. Substantially all of the carbon dioxide and a minor portion of the methane comprises the permeate stream which is disposed of and a major portion of the methane and a minor portion of the carbon dioxide comprises the residue stream which is then recirculated to the regeneration gas stream.
